        January 26, 1950 was a day of great pride for our nation. It was on this day that the Constitution of India came
        into effect, and the nation became a republic in the true sense of the word. All of us are aware of the immense
        struggle of our leaders to bring the nation to a position where it could be called a republic. But that was not
        all. The big question which prevailed thereafter was the one of development — economic, social and scientific.
        If we talk about scientific development specifically, there’s one name which comes to every mind — Dr. APJ Abdul
        Kalam.</p>
      <p>A very simple person who lived an unpretentious lifestyle. He had a keen interest in literature and wrote
        poems.
        He never married. He always faced media himself for his failures while let others address for the success. He
        remained active till the very end. He died while delivering a lecture at the IIM.</p>
